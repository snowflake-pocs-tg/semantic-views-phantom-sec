[ INTRODUCTION ]

I HAVE A CUSTOMER, PHANTOM SEC INC THAT IS INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT SNOWFLAKES SEMANTIC VIEW FEATURE.  INSTEAD OF DOING A BASIC DEMO, I'M LOOKING TO SETUP A HANDS ON LAB THAT I CAN RUN WITH THEM FOR A 1 HOUR SESSION.

THEY ARE LOOKING TO CREATE A SLACK EMBEDDED CORTEX ANALYST APP FOR THEM TO ROLL OUT COMPANY WIDE SO THAT ANALYSTS DON'T HAVE TO KEEP BUILDING CUSTOM DASHBOARDS FOR ONE OFF REQUESTS AND THE C-SUITE IS ALSO LOOKING FOR THIS.

[ POC SOLUTION ]
WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS CREATE SOME FAKE DATA MODELS THAT I CAN BUILD A SEMANTIC VIEW FROM AND THEN SHOW THEM HOW TO LEVERAGE THIS VIEW WITH CORTEX ANALYST & SNOWFLAKE INTELLIGENCE.  SI IS SNOWFLAKES VERSION OF AN AGENT - I THINK THIS WILL BE MORE SUITABLE FOR PHANTOM SEC VS CREATING AN APP in Slack.

[ BUSINESS CONTEXT ]
HERE'S A SAMPLE THE CUSTOMER PROVIDED IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR:

"""
The idea is to integrate a cortex analyst/agent in slack that will enable users asking questions like
“What was the ARR in Jan 2025” and then they get a natural language response in slack and also the corresponding sql.
"""

SYNTHETIC DATA SHOULD ALIGN WITH BUSINESS RELATED QUESTIONS FOR THIS COMPANY AND THE INDUSTRY THEY SERVE

[ TASKS ]
WHAT I NEED FROM YOU IS THE FOLLOWING:

1. ANALYZE THE URLS IN LINKS.TXT
2. PERFORM RESEARCH ON PHANTOM SEC, I STORED THEIR SITES LINK IN THIS DOC SO USE THIS AND DO YOUR OWN SEARH ONLINE.  I'LL NEED YOU TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE SERVICE(S) THEY PROVIDE, THEIR TYPICAL CUSTOMER BASE ETC. INFORMATION GATHERED HERE SHOULD HELP USE DERIVE MOCK USE CASES TO SOLVE IN THIS HANDS ON LAB
3. IDEATE SOME SYNTHETIC DATA WE CAN CREATE TO SOLVE USE CASES
4. SCRAPE THE SNOWFLAKE DOCS SO THAT YOU CAN LEARN MORE ABOUT SEMANTI VIEWS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION

AFTER YOU'VE COMPLETED THE TASKS ABOVE, PLEASE CREATE A DETAILED GAMEPLAN THAT OUTLINES THE MOCK PROBLEM STATEMENTS, HOW THE USES CASES WE SOLVE FOR CAN ALIG WITH THEIR GOALS, AND HOW WE SHOULD MODEL THE DATA. 

ALSO INCLUDE NOTES ON HOW WE SHOULD STRUCTURE THE BASE TABLES AND THE SEMANTIC VIEW FROM THESE TABLES. THE SEMANTIC VIEW QUERY WE CREATE IS ESSENTIALLY WRAPPED IN CORTEX ANALYST SO THE API CALLS FROM SLACK WILL BE MADE TO THIS WRAPPER.

ONCE YOU HAVE THAT, SAVE IT IN A MARKDOWN FILE NAMED GAMEPLAN.md


[ SYNTHETIC DATA ]
WE CAN DIVE MORE INTO THIS STRATEGY ONCE WE'RE ALIGNED ON A PLAN FOR THE MOCK DATA
