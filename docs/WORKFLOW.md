# WORKFLOW.md - Phantom Sec POC Development Progress

## Project Overview

Building a proof-of-concept demonstrating Snowflake Semantic Views with Cortex Analyst integration for Phantom Sec Inc. The goal is to create a hands-on lab showing how natural language queries can provide analytics on compliance automation metrics without needing custom dashboards.

**Key Requirement**: Enable queries like "What was our total ARR in Q4 2024?" with natural language responses and corresponding SQL.

## Timeline & Progress

### Phase 1: Initial Setup & Research ✅

#### 1. Repository Structure Created
- `PROMPT.md` - Original project requirements
- `LINKS.txt` - Reference URLs for Snowflake docs and Phantom Sec website
- `CLAUDE.md` - Repository guidance for future Claude instances
- `GAMEPLAN.md` - Comprehensive implementation strategy

#### 2. Research Completed
- **Snowflake Semantic Views**: Analyzed documentation for overview, SQL syntax, examples, validation rules, and querying
- **Phantom Sec Business Model**: 
  - $100M+ ARR, 8,000+ customers
  - Compliance automation across 35+ frameworks
  - 526% customer ROI, 50% faster audit prep
  - Key frameworks: SOC2, ISO27001, HIPAA, GDPR, PCI DSS

#### 3. Strategic Decisions Made
- **Original Plan**: Slack integration for queries
- **Updated Plan**: Use Snowflake Intelligence as the interface (simplified architecture)
- **Geographic Focus**: Changed from USA, Canada, Germany, France → USA only
- **Data Volume**: 200 customers, 5 tables, ~10,000 total records

### Phase 2: Data Model Design ✅

#### 1. Table Structure Defined

**Dimension Tables**:
- `DIM_CUSTOMERS` - Customer master data
- `DIM_COMPLIANCE_FRAMEWORKS` - Framework reference data

**Fact Tables**:
- `FACT_SUBSCRIPTION_EVENTS` - Revenue transactions
- `FACT_FRAMEWORK_ADOPTIONS` - Compliance implementations
- `FACT_COMPLIANCE_ACTIVITIES` - Granular work events

#### 2. ERD Created
- `ERD.md` - Entity relationship diagram in Mermaid format
- Shows all foreign key relationships and cardinalities
- Supports star schema for semantic view optimization

#### 3. Detailed Specifications
Each table includes:
- Field-level specifications with all categorical values
- Mockaroo generation guidelines
- Temporal flow requirements
- Business logic rules

### Phase 3: Data Generation ✅

#### 1. DIM_CUSTOMERS Table ✅
**Initial Generation Issues**:
- Generated 300 records in Mockaroo (saved as `MOCK_DATA.json`)
- Discovered critical data quality issues:
  - Wrong segment distribution (expected 50/37.5/12.5%, got 32.3/30.7/37.0%)
  - 62.7% of records had employee counts misaligned with segments
  - Revenue ranges not correlated with segments

**Data Cleaning Process**:
- Created `clean_customers.py` script
- Fixed all business logic violations:
  - Rebalanced to exactly 200 records with correct segment distribution
  - Aligned employee counts: startup (1-50), mid-market (51-500), enterprise (501-10,000)
  - Aligned revenue ranges: startup ($100K-$5M), mid-market ($5M-$100M), enterprise ($100M-$1B)
  - Added sequential customer_id field
- Output: `DIM_CUSTOMERS.json` (clean, validated data)

**Current Status**: ✅ DIM_CUSTOMERS updated to 300 records with 5-year range

#### 2. DIM_COMPLIANCE_FRAMEWORKS Table ✅
**Generation Process**:
- Created `generate_frameworks.py` script for 8 static framework records
- Generated reference data with business characteristics:
  - SOC2 Type I/II, ISO27001, HIPAA, GDPR, PCI DSS, FedRAMP, NIST CSF
  - Complexity scores (1-10), completion days, costs, automation percentages
  - Industry relevance and geographic scope mapping

## Key Learnings & Decisions

### 1. Data Generation Approach Evolution
- **Initial Approach**: Mockaroo for quick generation, manual cleanup if needed
- **Final Approach**: Python scripts for complex business logic and temporal dependencies
- **Benefits**: Better control over data quality, business rule enforcement, temporal consistency
- **Scripts Created**: `clean_customers.py`, `generate_frameworks.py`, `generate_subscription_events.py`, `generate_framework_adoptions.py`, `generate_compliance_activities.py`, `quality_checks.py`, `mrr_billing_validation.py`

### 2. Critical Business Realism Fixes
- **Contract Length Issue**: Initial 1-6 month contracts were unrealistic for B2B SaaS compliance tools
  - **Root Cause**: Compliance is a long-term business need, not a short-term project
  - **Solution**: Updated to 12-36 month contracts with proper segment distribution
- **Discount Percentage Issue**: Initial discounts up to 30% were unrealistic for B2B SaaS industry
  - **Root Cause**: B2B SaaS companies rarely offer deep discounts due to high value and switching costs
  - **Solution**: Capped at 5% with realistic patterns (2-5% for annual payment, 1-3% for multi-year)
- **Billing Period Issue**: Monthly/annual didn't reflect B2B SaaS compliance tool patterns
  - **Root Cause**: Enterprise customers prefer quarterly/annual for budget predictability
  - **Solution**: Added quarterly (35.4%) and upfront (4.5%) billing options

### 3. Temporal Dependencies & Data Expansion
- **Date Range Expansion**: Extended customer signup dates from narrow range to 5-year span (2020-2024)
- **Customer Volume**: Increased from 200 to 300 customers for more variability
- **Temporal Flow**: Maintained chronological order: signup → subscription → adoption → activities
- **Contract Cycles**: Aligned renewal events with contract end dates, not billing cycles

### 4. USA Compliance Focus
Simplified to USA-only with clear framework adoption patterns:
- SOC2: 95% adoption (universal for B2B SaaS)
- HIPAA: 95% for healthtech, 5% others
- PCI DSS: 90% for ecommerce/fintech, 15% others
- ISO27001: 40% (international business)
- GDPR: 35% (European customer data)
