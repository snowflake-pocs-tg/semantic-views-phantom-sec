# Snowflake Semantic Views with Cortex Analyst - Compliance Analytics POC

## 🎯 Overview

This proof-of-concept demonstrates how **Snowflake Semantic Views** combined with **Cortex Analyst** can transform complex compliance and business data into natural language insights, eliminating the need for custom dashboards or technical SQL knowledge.

**The Challenge**: Compliance teams, executives, and customer success managers need instant answers to business questions like *"What was our total ARR in Q4 2024?"* or *"How much time are we saving customers through automation?"* - but traditional BI tools require complex dashboard creation and SQL expertise.

**The Solution**: Semantic Views act as a business-friendly translation layer over your data warehouse, enabling anyone to ask questions in plain English and receive both conversational answers and the underlying SQL queries.
